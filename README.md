# Ordermentum Swift SDK

## Objectives

• Library will support common API calls and ability to compose objects that return Ordermentum specfic data.

• Library wil be framework agnostic.

• Library will be in Swift with the option compilation targets to different software and hardware platforms.

# Requirements

iOS 10.0+ / macOS 10.12+ / tvOS 10.0+ / watchOS 3.0+
Xcode 10.1+
Swift 4.2+

# Installation

## CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Ordermentum into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

`pod 'Ordermentum'`

## Security
• Security should be a first class citizen

• Authenticated calls (at some point this will be public and this needs to be considered during the build)

• Should allow app-testing and app (server switching)


## Permissions

• Data access


## Stuff to Think About

• Any code should be re-usable.

• Create frameworks/pods.
